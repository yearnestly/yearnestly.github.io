## Get Out of Your Country

```tsql
"Now the LORD had said to Abram: 
'Get out of your country, 
from your family and from your father's house, 
to a land that I will show you.'"
    - Gen. 12:1
```

Living in hisfather's camp/city was security for Abram. A safety net. <br>
Abram was not necessarily sinning in Haran with his dad and relations, <br>
but the LORD asked him to remove himself from the safe place and "step out of the boat", so to speak. <br>
Where would we be if he had simply said, "You know what, LORD, this land is fine and I'm comfortable here"?

SOMEtimes, for the Lord to work freely in our lives, to move in power, He requires us to step out in faith. 
To leave the safety net behind. <br>
Perhaps even ALL the time. <br>
If it seems like a safe bet to the world, perhaps we need to make sure we are still in God's will?


## Prayer
Holy Spirit, fill me and move in me to help me recognize when You need me to move <br>
and when You need me to be still and know that You are God.<br>

Amen.
