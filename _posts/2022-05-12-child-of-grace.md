## Child of Grace

```tsql
"And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; 
  and the grace of God was upon Him."
    - Luke 2:40
```

In the Gospels, Jesus, being fully God yet fully man, did not do miracles until filled with the Holy Spirit (following His baptism by John). 

By which the Lord shows us that we are capable of being indwelt by the same Spirit, if we humble ourselves in obedience to seek His face and righteousness. 

I love this because this verse shows that this could be <i>our</i> children; becoming strong in spirit, filled with wisdom and having the <i>grace</i> of God upon them. It was not the exceptional skill of Mary and Joseph as parents that accomplished this. 

It was the Father's grace.

## Prayer
Father, I pray that the same grace Jesus grew up under would cover our children.

Where we fall short, Lord, Your amazing grace - Your unmerited favor - can more than fill the void.

We love You and pray that You instruct us all in Your wisdom.

Amen.
