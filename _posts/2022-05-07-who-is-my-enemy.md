## Who is My Enemy?

```tsql
"That we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us..."
    - Luke 1:71
```

Since the Lord was sent to redeem Gentiles as well as Jews (and the Lord knew it would be so), who is the "we" of which Zacharias prophesies? It is ALL people.

Then who is left to be the enemy? Not people, that's for sure!

The Lord impressed upon me that this reinforces His Word spoken in Ephesians 6:12 that we are not enemies with flesh and blood humans, but "principalities and powers". Spiritual forces of wickedness in "heavenly places" - unsubtly referring to Satan and his minions. 

No matter how awful a person may be to you, they are not the enemy! Remember Stephen when he said, "Lord, do not lay this sin to their charge!" (Acts 7:60)

## Prayer
Father, I pray for Your grace to walk not by sight, but faith; not by the flesh, but the spirit, and to consider all men and women worthy of the same love and mercy which You have shown me.

Amen.
