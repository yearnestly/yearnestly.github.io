## Do You Know Where He Leads?

```tsql
"Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan
  and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness."
    - Luke 4:1
```

Jesus did not actively <i>decide</i> to go. He was <b>led</b> by the Spirit.<br>
When He was on His way, did He think the Spirit was leading him <i>through</i> the wilderness, rather than <i>into</i> it?

When we are in a spiritual wilderness,<br>
or a wilderness in our living arrangements...<br>
or job... <br>
or circumstances... <br>
or whatever... <br>
and we pray for God to end or change it, <br>
perhaps we should stop and consider whether or not God is leading us <i>into</i> the wilderness. <br>
<br>
Jesus was being sanctified for something extraordinary <b><i>in the wilderness</i></b>, not on the other side of it.<br>
<br>
Follow the Spirit, stay near Him, listen... and do not assume that you know the destination.<br>


## Prayer
Father, thank You for the Holy Spirit's guidance and comfort. <br>
I pray that I will be able to follow when led and to give thanks IN all things.

Amen.
