## Withdraw and Pray

```tsql
"So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed."
    - Luke 5:16
```

Jesus did not hesitate to pour Himself out for the multitudes or to serve them,<br>
healing them and casting out demons.<br>
As a direct result, He "often withdrew" and,<br>
in solitude, communicated with the Father.

The implication is that if Jesus needed this time of recharging,<br>
how much more so do we?<br>
To remain powerful vessels for the service of the Lord,<br>
we must withdraw to the wilderness often and meet our Father in prayer.<br>

## Prayer
Jesus, thank you for this beautiful example.<br>
I pray that by your grace, I can always <i>make</i> time<br>
to meet You in prayer and worship,<br>
that I might become and effective tool for the working of your will on Earth.<br>

Amen.
